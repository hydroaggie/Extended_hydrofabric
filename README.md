# Extended_hydrofabric

This project aims to improve water management modeling by integrating water management models (WMMs) with hydrologic models using extended hydrofabric and optional databases. The goal is to address the limitations of current hydrologic models, such as the USGS National Hydrologic Model (NHM), which do not adequately account for human activities like water diversions, and reservoir management. By incorporating these elements, the extended hydrofabric will enhance streamflow prediction and watershed management.

## Key Components
* Extended Hydrofabric: Including water management infrastructure
* Optional Databases: A comprehensive relational database for water management data connected to the Extended Hydrofabric.
* Software Tools: open-source tools for efficient preparation of Extended hydrofabric, optional databases, and WMM inputs.
